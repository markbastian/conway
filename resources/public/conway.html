    <p>I'm just getting started with the whole &quot;Share with the world&quot; concept and have decided it would be
        better to present this in a blog format.</p>

    <p>So, please, ignore everything you see below and go
        <a href="http://fn-code.blogspot.com/2015/03/conways-game-of-life-demonstration-and.html">here</a> instead.
        Same content, better format. For your troubles I promise to deliver more content in the future.</p>

    <h1 class="cover-heading">The Project</h1>
    <p>I wanted to create an interesting project in Clojure that had the following features:
    <ul>
        <li>The project should be simple, but interesting</li>
        <li>The project should demonstrate how Clojure, ClojureScript, and CLJX interact</li>
        <li>There should be some cool Clojure features to learn about</li>
        <li>I wanted to demonstrate how to achieve state in a stateless world</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I chose to program up Conway's Game of Life, a simple zero-player cellular automaton. It's a fun little simulation
    and meets all of my criterion. Here's what it looks like:</p>
</div>

<div class="container">
    <canvas id="myCanvas" width="400" height="400" style="border:1px solid #000000;"></canvas>
</div>

<div class="container">
    <p class="lead">
        <a href="#" id="reset" class="btn btn-lg btn-default">Reset</a>
    </p>
</div>

<div class="container">
    <h1 class="cover-heading">The Rules</h1>
    <p>Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton in which a population of cells evolves with the
        following rules:
    <ul>
    <li>A living cell with only one or two neighbors dies</li>
    <li>A living cell with two or three live neighbors survives</li>
    <li>A living cell with greater than three neighbors dies</li>
    <li>A dead cell with exactly three neighbors comes to life</li>
    </ul>
</div>


<div class="container">
    <h1 class="cover-heading">Postmortem</h1>
</div>

<div class="container">
    <h2 class="cover-heading">Implementation in Clojure</h2>
    <p>This project was coded up in Clojure as an example of what can be done using the clj/cljs/cljx
        integration. It was done in three main files: rules.cljx, swingui.clj, and canvasui.cljs. Below you will find
    the complete listing of the rules and canvasui namespaces. the swingui namespace is available via git
        <a href="https://github.com/markbastian/conway">here</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="container">
    <h3>rules.cljx</h3>
    <p>Here's a listing of the entire &quot;rule engine&quot; for the application.</p>
<pre class="brush: clj; ruler: false">
(ns conway.rules)

(defn gen-cell[](if (> (Math/random) 0.7) :alive :dead))

(defn seed-grid [rows cols]
  (vec (take rows (repeatedly (fn [] (vec (take cols (repeatedly gen-cell))))))))

(defn neighbors [[i j]]
  (let [x ((juxt inc inc identity dec dec dec identity inc) i)
        y ((juxt identity inc inc inc identity dec dec dec) j)]
    (map vector x y)))

(defn count-neighbors [grid coord]
  (let [n (map #(get-in grid %) (neighbors coord))]
    (count (filter #(= % :alive) n))))

(defn sim-step [grid coord]
  (let [n-live (count-neighbors grid coord)]
    (if (= :alive (get-in grid coord))
      (case n-live
        (2 3) :alive
        :dead)
      (if (= 3 n-live) :alive :dead))))

(defn step [grid]
  (into [] (for [i (range (count grid))]
          (into [] (for [j (range (count (get grid i)))]
                  (sim-step grid [i j]))))))
</pre>
    <p>Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this project is the amount of code (and I mean the small amount) written
        to do this complete implementation. I am continually amazed as I write more Clojure about the expressiveness
        and conciseness of the language. Another thing to point out about this file is the cljx extension. By using this, I
        can write code that cross-compiles to target both the JVM and the browser via JavaScript. Pretty cool, eh?</p>

    <p>Finally, I wanted to point out my favorite function in this program: juxt. the Clojure juxt function creates a
        function that performs a sequence of operations on a single item and returns that result as an indexed data
        structure. This is a perfect function for computing the neighbors of a cell in a grid. This is way better than
        having 8 sequential function calls in which you compute steps to the right, upper right, top center, upper left,
        and so on.</p>
</div>

<div class="container">
    <h3>canvasui.cljx</h3>
    <p>And here is the complete listing for the interface in HTML.</p>
<pre class="brush: clj">
(ns conway.canvasui
  (:require [conway.rules :as rules]))

(defn draw-background [canvas ctx]
  (doto ctx
    (-> .-fillStyle (set! "#000000"))
    (.fillRect 0 0 (.-width canvas) (.-height canvas))))

(defn draw-and-update-grid [canvas ctx grid dim]
  (let [dx (/ (.-width canvas) dim)
        dy (/ (.-height canvas) dim)]
    (do
    (draw-background canvas ctx)
    (-> ctx .-fillStyle (set! "#00FF00"))
    (doseq [i (range (count @grid))]
      (doseq [j (range (count (get @grid i)))]
        (when (= :alive (get-in @grid [i j]))
          (.fillRect ctx (* dx i) (* dy j) dx dy))))
    (swap! grid rules/step))))

(set!
  (.-onload js/window)
  (when (and js/document (.-getElementById js/document))
    (let [cells 50
          grid (atom (rules/seed-grid cells cells))
          canvas (.getElementById js/document "myCanvas")
          reset-button (.getElementById js/document "reset")
          ctx (.getContext canvas "2d")]
      (do
        (js/setInterval #(draw-and-update-grid canvas ctx grid cells) 10)
        (set! (.-onclick reset-button) #(reset! grid (rules/seed-grid cells cells)))))))
</pre>
    <p>Again, it is amazing how few lines of code were written for this demo.</p>
    <p>Finally, take a look at how state is managed in the program. Notice that there are no defs (global variables
        within the namespace) anywhere. All of the state is managed by a single atom (line 25) that is created within the
        initialization section of the script and is passed to each function. The draw-and-update-grid function draws and
        updates the grid (as you might expect) while the reset button is used to reset the grid. Since atoms are
        synchronous, I don't need to worry about any sort of concurrency problems. It just works.</p>
    <p>This is a very common pattern in the Clojure world for designing applications. You have three elements:
    <ol>
        <li>A set of rules that can be thought of as an API or DSL for your project. These rules consist only of defns
            or perhaps defs that define constants. They are used to transform or analyze a model. They are completely stateless.</li>
        <li>A very small number of Clojure concurrency primitives that manage the actual state of the application. In
            this case, there is only 1 - the grid atom. You might have other primitives, such as one for preferences, but
            the number should be small and separated by concerns.</li>
        <li>A user interface layer. It could be Swing, an HTML app using ClojureScript, or just a repl.</li>
    </ol><p>
    Coming from a background in 10+ years of Java and then about 6 years of Scala, this
    was something it took me a while to understand, but now I can't live without. When I got deep into Scala I really
    loved it, but had the hardest time figuring out how to manage state. With Clojure everything is just baked in.</p>

    <h1 class="cover-heading">In Conclusion</h1>
    <p>I was able to write up a simple cross-platform application in just a handful of lines of code using the amazing
        powers of Clojure, ClojureScript, and the cljx project. Despite its simplicity, there are some great things to learn
        from the project. If you want to see the entire project, check it out
        <a href="https://github.com/markbastian/conway">here</a> or my entire github repo

    have other projects like this in the future, and your support and interest is the fuel that drives the effort.</p>
